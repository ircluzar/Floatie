# Floatie
floatie makes things float on your desktop
a bit like streaming stuff but without streaming stuff

written in c#, for .NET 5

floatie stays in your systray for easy access
you can drag and drop stuff into a floatie to pop another
you can copy and paste stuff into a floatie to pop another

you can pop a scrambler floatie from the systray
you can pop a censor floatie from the systray

static images work
webpages work
automatically saving current floaties works
